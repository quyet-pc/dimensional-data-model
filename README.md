# 1. What is dimensional data model?
Is a denormalization technique, where a fact table is surrounded by multiple dimensions and constraint by primary and foreign keys
# 2. Importance of Dimensional Data model
- To ensure data quality and accuracy in a database
- To define relationships, primary and foreign keys
- To provide optimized database for fast queries  
# 3. Difference Between Dimension, Fact, Fact Tables
# 4. Dimensional Data Model Design Process
- Identify the business process: The operational activities being modeled
- Declare the grain: The lowest level of information
- Define Dimension Tables: Contain the descriptive entities of the data
- Identify the Facts: are the numeric measurements that result from a business process

  A Fact Table contains:
  + The numeric measures
  + Foreign keys of the associated dimensions
  + Degenerate dimension keys
  + Date/time stamps
# 5. Case Study 
In the realm of data analysis, it's common for Data Analysts to construct dimensional data models based on existing databases. The following is a simple model generated by ChatGPT, with additional tables and attributes based on my experience
